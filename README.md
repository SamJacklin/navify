# Navify

🧠 **Navify is a focused-mode productivity panel for large codebases.**

It doesn’t replace the Explorer — it sits alongside it.

Navify helps you narrow your working scope, reduce visual noise, and move quickly between the files that matter right now.

## 🎯 What Problem Does Navify Solve?

In large repositories:

- The Explorer becomes noisy  
- Context switching is expensive  
- You lose track of what you were just working on  

Navify provides a **focused working layer** on top of VS Code’s native tools.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 📂 Explorer Plus — Focused Folder Views

Select one or two folders and treat them as your active workspace.

- Expand and collapse just the areas you're working in  
- Keep unrelated parts of the repo out of sight  
- Switch focus without closing or restructuring anything  

This is not a replacement for Explorer — it's a *working subset* view.

**Best for:**
- Large monorepos  
- Feature-specific work  
- Temporary focus during refactors

### 🔎 Fast File Search

Search across your workspace without leaving the panel.

- Lightweight fuzzy matching  
- Immediate filtering  
- Quick-open behavior  
- Designed for fast keyboard use  

Built for momentum — not configuration.

### 🕑 Recently Opened Files

Quickly return to files you've worked on.

- Automatically tracked  
- Lightweight and contextual  
- Reduces back-and-forth navigation  

This acts as a working memory layer for your session.

## 🛠 Roadmap

Planned productivity enhancements:

- ⭐ Pinned / bookmarked files  
- 🧭 Back/forward navigation (like a browser)  
- 🔄 Jump between related files (e.g. `foo.ts` ↔ `foo.test.ts`)  
- 📝 One-click Git diff viewer  
- ⚙️ Enhanced in-panel settings  

Navify aims to stay focused — features will be added only if they reduce friction.
